# SOC Automation Lab

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a fully integrated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment with **automated threat detection, enrichment, and response**.  
It integrates:
- **Wazuh** (SIEM/EDR)
- **Suricata** (IDS/IPS)
- **MISP** (Threat Intelligence Sharing)
- **TheHive & Cortex** (Incident Response & Analysis)
- **Shuffle** (SOAR Automation)

## Wazuh

### Deployment

For Docker deployment of Wazuh, the guide [Wazuh Docker Deployment](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/deployment-options/docker/wazuh-container.html) was followed.  
Wazuh was deployed in **single-node mode**. After deployment, you can access the UI at: https://<server-ip-address>


**Default login:** `admin:SecretPassword`  
**DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE LOGIN DEFAULT CREDENTIALS**
<img width="1720" height="860" alt="wazuh-ui" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b1b7232-12bd-4b54-ae6c-7f8c842bb404" />


---

### Agents Setup

1. Go to **Agents Management â†’ Summary â†’ Deploy New Agents**.  
2. Choose the OS and corresponding architecture (Debian amd64 for Ubuntu server in this case).  
3. Enter the IP address of the agent.  

<img width="1789" height="895" alt="agent-page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cdeb3b9-b565-4017-a5d6-0932521d5e70" />


4. You will be presented with a series of commands to run on your agent's CLI.  
5. After executing the commands, the agent should appear in your **Agents Summary** list.  

<img width="1920" height="730" alt="wazuh-agent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/976368ae-82a4-4008-97b7-a2792c4d80fd" />


For a more comprehensive guide, refer to the [Wazuh Agent Installation Guide](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-agent/index.html).

### File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) Integration

1. Access the configuration file:
/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf

2. Locate the `<fim>` block and review or modify as desired.  
3. In this project, a folder was added to simulate FIM alerts, with the `realtime` parameter for instantaneous detection.

<img width="1881" height="940" alt="fim-block" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae97da47-374c-4c0b-9182-013ca280856b" />


4. To check FIM activity on agents, navigate to **Endpoint Security â†’ File Integrity Monitoring**.  
5. Select a specific agent via **Explore Agent** to view **Dashboard, Inventory, and Events** for detailed information.

<img width="1739" height="869" alt="fim-page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a10c56-91a3-4ba4-99bf-8bf3c2ec718a" />


---

### Active Response (AR)

For this lab, Wazuh's AR feature is demonstrated using the `firewall-drop` command.
<img width="1920" height="601" alt="firewall-drop-command-block" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b48f86cd-f04e-4fc9-b5b5-7a06733b29ef" />

1. Open `ossec.conf` and locate the `<active-response>` section.  
2. Add a block for the `firewall-drop` command to enable it.

<img width="1920" height="246" alt="active-response-block" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfd977e-a47a-4789-8c63-461675db98e8" />


Wazuhâ€™s documentation for Active Response is comprehensive and can be found [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/active-response/index.html).


---
### Suricata integration
> **Note:** This step should be attempted after deploying suricata and noting down its log directory, in my case it was /var/log/suricata, but you should check that it is in /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

in ossec.conf, add the following block under the localfiles section to enable the suricata integration: 
```bash
<!-- Add this new block for Suricata -->
  <localfile>
    <log_format>json</log_format> <!-- #> ... Tells Wazuh to parse each line as a JSON object -->
    <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location> <!-- #> again, must match the path in suricata.yaml -->
  </localfile>

```
Then we can view suricata logs from explore -> discover. We can see that the log location is the log directory we configured in the ossec file  
<img width="1920" height="666" alt="suricata-integration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c5d45fe-bf78-4811-8630-609ee8a4655f" />

---

## MISP

### Deployment

MISP was deployed using Docker via the repository: [MISP Docker](https://github.com/MISP/misp-docker).  

> **Note:** Before running `docker-compose up`, adjust the **port mapping** for `misp-core` in the `docker-compose.yml` file to avoid conflicts.  

<img width="1670" height="835" alt="misp-core" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4da18b-14ff-4615-8c84-97ba9115a3f0" />


Start the containers:
docker-compose up -d

Access the MISP web interface at:
https://<server-ip>:8443
> **Note:** Default login: `admin@admin.test:admin.`
**DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE LOGIN DEFAULT CREDENTIALS**
<img width="1593" height="797" alt="misp-ui" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c92c4bc2-2ea1-4eee-b460-a8da99d6730b" />


### Organization & Feeds

Create your own organization in MISP.

Navigate to Sync Actions â†’ Feeds.

Add new feeds or enable one of the default feeds by clicking Load Default Feed Metadata, then enable the desired feeds.
<img width="1712" height="856" alt="enabled-feeds" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e818ab92-9779-4d7a-b731-bb0b6287df39" />

All feed events are visible on the Home tab.
<img width="1782" height="891" alt="events-screen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/207cdbb6-569c-4938-b6b5-8bdacf6a1ad5" />

### API Keys

For workflow integrations (e.g., Suricata and TheHive), create API keys:

Go to Admin â†’ Auth Keys.

Generate new keys for each integration.

Important: Note the keys immediately after creation.... they are only visible once.

# Cortex & TheHive Setup Guide

## Deployment
Cortex and TheHive were deployed using the **testing environment** deployment profile from StrangeBee:  
ðŸ”— [StrangeBee Docker Repository](https://github.com/StrangeBeeCorp/docker/tree/main/testing)

- The **nginx port mapping** was changed to `7443:443` to avoid conflicts with Wazuh and MISP.
- Access URLs:  
  - Cortex â†’ `https://<ip>:7443/cortex`  
  - TheHive â†’ `https://<ip>:7443/thehive`
**DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE LOGIN DEFAULT CREDENTIALS**
---

## Cortex Setup
1. On first access, youâ€™ll be asked to **set the database** (configure the first user login credentials).
   <img width="1724" height="862" alt="cortex-ui" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5facfe44-a6de-4545-acdf-503ffbcbb021" />

   - After creating the initial username and password, log in to create:
     - Your organization  
     - An organization user with the proper permissions  
      <img width="1920" height="547" alt="cortex-org" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbd6262-4340-4475-a3d7-1448a0baab7d" />

3. **Analyzers & Responders**  
   - These can only be configured **after logging in with your organization user account**.  
   - Go to **Organization > Analyzers** and enable the desired analyzers.
     <img width="1920" height="242" alt="analyzers-tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe6098c9-8bf5-45f4-bffe-e7ce8f2bfecb" />
 
   - Most analyzers require an **API key** (obtainable by signing up on the analyzerâ€™s respective website).  
   - Once enabled, analyzers will appear under the **Analyzers tab** (uppermost menu).  
<img width="1920" height="696" alt="cortex analyzers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/598e6411-a902-45e7-b491-29676a0282aa" />

4. **Save Org Admin API Key**  
   - Note down the **OrgAdminâ€™s API key** for later use in **MISP** and **Shuffle integrations**.

---

## TheHive Setup
1. Default login credentials:  
   - **Email:** `admin@thehive.local`  
   - **Password:** `secret`  

2. After logging in, create your organizations.

3. **Configure Connectors**  
   - Go to: **Platform Management > Connectors**  
   - Configure servers under the **Cortex** and **MISP** tabs.  
   - Each requires the **URL** and **API key** of the service.  
   - Use the **"Check connection"** button to test connectivity before enabling.  
   - Successful integrations can be confirmed under the **License tab** (server stats visible).     <img width="1920" height="764" alt="thehice license tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030dd431-9af8-4a2b-acb4-63967cfe2bad" />
 

4. **Save Organization API Key**  
   - Now access you organization's user accound, go to **Account Settings > API Key** to generate/save your organization userâ€™s API key.  
   - This will be used for **Shuffle integration**.  

5. You can press the **Cortex icon** in TheHive UI to view configured servers.
